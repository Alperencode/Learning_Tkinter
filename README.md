<h2>Repository Description</h2>
<p>
This repository created when i decided to learn Tkinter module on python for creating apps with GUI.
Because i made a lot of things with python like games, library apps,airport apps but they were all on black terminal and not very attractive for users who is not similar with python.
So i decided to learn tkinter and make apps that have GUI.
